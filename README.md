# SS1TexConverter
A texture converter for the Serious Sam Classics/Revolution .tex format

Written by reverse-engineering the previous converter written in VB6, which sadly doesn't work on modern machines anymore.
I've also added a few minor things like the ability to copy the currently selected texture to your clipboard and drag'n'dropping files to add them to the batch processing.

List of supported file formats:
- TGA (Uncompressed, 24/32bpp)
- JPEG
- PNG
- BMP
- TIFF
